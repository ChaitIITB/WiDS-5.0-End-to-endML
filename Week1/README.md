# Week 1: Plant Disease Classification - Getting Started 🌱

Hey everyone! 👋 

## Dataset

We'll be using the PlantVillage dataset for this project:
- **Link**: [PlantVillage Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset/data)

### Setup Notes
- Download instructions are available on Kaggle's website
- For EDA, use available Kaggle notebooks instead of downloading the entire dataset locally
- We're assuming you can handle the basic setup (downloading dataset, environment configuration)

## Week 1 Requirements

### Must-Do Resources (Compulsory)

Complete all of these resources and implement the concepts:

1. **Neptune.ai EDA Guide** (Image datasets exploration)
   - Focus: Class imbalance, augmentations, small objects
   - Link: [Data Exploration for Image Segmentation and Object Detection](https://neptune.ai/blog/data-exploration-for-image-segmentation-and-object-detection)

2. **OpenCV Crash Course** (3 hours)
   - Focus: Image manipulation basics
   - Link: [OpenCV University Free Courses](https://opencv.org/university/free-courses/)

3. **Fast.ai Lesson 1** (90 minutes)
   - Focus: Build your first image classifier
   - Link: [Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning - Lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html)

4. **Plant Disease Tutorial** (45 minutes)
   - Focus: End-to-end CNN project with Docker
   - Link: [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Tqf1w5d0I)

5. **PlantVillage Dataset Exploration** (45 minutes)
   - Focus: Explore the dataset, perform basic EDA
   - Link: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)

**What This Covers**: PyTorch basics, vision fundamentals, and EDA – everything you need before diving into federated learning with Flower, FastAPI, and deployment.

### Optional Resources (If You Finish Early)

Want more depth? Check these out:

- **Hugging Face Computer Vision Course**: [HF CV Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course)
- **PyImageSearch Free Crash Course**: [OpenCV + Deep Learning Crash Course](https://pyimagesearch.com/free-opencv-computer-vision-deep-learning-crash-course/)

## Week 1 Goal

By the end of Week 1, everyone should be comfortable with:
- Image loading and preprocessing
- Basic data augmentation techniques
- Training a simple classifier

**Next Steps**: Scale to federated systems + production deployment 🚀
