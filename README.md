Hey everyone! 👋
The dataset that we will be using for this is this: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset/data 

There are some baby steps like downloading the dataset, and setting up the environment, butt we are assuming you will be able to do those, the instructions are given on kaggle's website. 

Some pointers:
It is better if for EDA, we use the available Kaggle notebooks, instead of downloading the entire dataset
here's what you have to do in week 1, 
You must implement the given things, we are not giving resources for downloading 

Must-do resources (compulsory):

Neptune.ai EDA guide – How to properly explore image datasets (class imbalance, augmentations, small objects, etc.)
https://neptune.ai/blog/data-exploration-for-image-segmentation-and-object-detection​

OpenCV Crash Course (3 hrs) – Image manipulation basics we'll use throughout
https://opencv.org/university/free-courses/​

Fast.ai Lesson 1 (90 min) – Build your first image classifier, super practical
https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html​​

Plant Disease Tutorial (45 min) – End-to-end CNN project with Docker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Tqf1w5d0I​

PlantVillage Dataset (45 min) – Explore the actual dataset, try basic EDA
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset​

This covers: PyTorch basics, vision fundamentals, and EDA – everything you need before we dive into federated learning with Flower, FastAPI, and deployment.​

Optional (if you finish early or want more depth):

Hugging Face CV Course: https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course​

PyImageSearch free crash course: https://pyimagesearch.com/free-opencv-computer-vision-deep-learning-crash-course/​

Goal: By week 1, everyone should be comfortable with image loading, basic augmentation, and training a simple classifier. Then we scale to federated systems + production deployment 🚀
